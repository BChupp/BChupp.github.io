                <p>I was born in Boston Massachusetts in the fall of 1994. I lived in Somerville, MA for two years until I moved to Madison, CT. I grew up in Madison and spent much of my time growing up building things and being creative. I often reused household appliances for my construction projects. I went to high school in Madison and graduated in 2013. For the past three years I have attended Tufts University School of Engineering in pursuit of a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. The summer after my first year, I worked for an engineering firm that manufactured precision fluidic control components. My second summer, I worked as a bicycle mechanic at Belmont WheelWorks. In my spare time I like to mountain bike, hike, watch television, snowboard in the winters and sail in the summers. I also like to do light woodworking and home improvement projects.</p>
